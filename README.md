# MotionPaper

MotionPaper is a Tkinter GUI for applying wallpapers from Steam Wallpaper Engine through `linux-wallpaperengine`.

Note that this was developed with the [`caelestia`](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell) rice in mind. Hyprpaper support is extremely experimental and not tested, therefore pull requests for Hyprpaper support (as well as other wallpaper backends) are welcome.

## Install (pipx)

`pipx` is the recommended Linux install path:

1. Install `pipx` (once):

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

2. Install MotionPaper from GitHub:

```bash
pipx install "git+https://github.com/kaemori/motionpaper.git"
```

3. Install desktop entries:

```bash
motionpaper-install
```

4. Launch:

```bash
motionpaper
```

## Install (curl bootstrap)

For a one-command install flow, use the bootstrap installer script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaemori/motionpaper/main/install.sh | bash
```

You can also run it with an explicit repository URL:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaemori/motionpaper/main/install.sh | bash -s -- "git+https://github.com/kaemori/motionpaper.git"
```

## Commands

- `motionpaper`: launch the GUI
- `motionpaper-daemon`: launch the daemon only
- `motionpaper-install`: install desktop entries under `~/.local/share/applications`

## Installed Files

When installed with `pipx`, MotionPaper is installed as a user app (not system-wide):

- Executables are exposed in `~/.local/bin` (for example `motionpaper`)
- App venv lives under `~/.local/pipx/venvs/motionpaper`
- Desktop entries are written to `~/.local/share/applications/motionpaper.desktop` and `~/.local/share/applications/motionpaper-daemon.desktop`
- App icon is copied to `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/motionpaper.png`
- Runtime config is stored in `~/.config/motionpaper`

## Uninstall

1. Uninstall package and commands:

```bash
pipx uninstall motionpaper
```

2. Remove desktop files and icon:

```bash
./uninstaller.sh
```

3. Remove config too (optional):

```bash
./uninstaller.sh --purge-config
```

## Local Development

If you are developing from source, you can still run the compatibility scripts:

```bash
./launch.sh
./daemon.sh
./install_to_desktop.sh
```

The launcher scripts prefer `./.venv/bin/python3` when present and fall back to `python3` from your `PATH`.

## Notes

- Config is stored at `~/.config/motionpaper/config.json`.
- The daemon PID file is stored at `/tmp/motionpaper-daemon.pid`.
- Wallpaper discovery uses Steam workshop path `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/431960`.
